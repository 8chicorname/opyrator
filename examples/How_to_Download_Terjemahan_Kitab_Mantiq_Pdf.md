Logic is the science of correct reasoning and argumentation. It helps us to distinguish between valid and invalid arguments, sound and unsound arguments, and true and false statements. Logic also helps us to analyze, evaluate, and construct arguments in various fields of knowledge, such as philosophy, theology, mathematics, science, law, and rhetoric.
 
Logic has a long and rich history in Islamic civilization. Many Muslim scholars contributed to the development and refinement of logic, especially in the classical and medieval periods. They wrote commentaries, summaries, and critiques of the works of Greek logicians, such as Aristotle, Porphyry, and Euclid. They also developed their own original theories and methods of logic, such as modal logic, temporal logic, conditional logic, and dialectical logic. They applied logic to various disciplines, such as metaphysics, ethics, jurisprudence, theology, and mysticism.
 
Some of the most influential Muslim logicians include Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Al-Ghazali, Ibn Rushd (Averroes), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Khaldun, and Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti. Their works on logic have been studied and transmitted by generations of students and scholars in the Islamic world and beyond. They have also inspired and influenced many thinkers in the Western world, such as Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon, William of Ockham, Rene Descartes, Gottfried Leibniz, Immanuel Kant, and Bertrand Russell.
